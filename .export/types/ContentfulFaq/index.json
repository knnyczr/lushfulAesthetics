The utilization of sound waves to increase the penetration of topical treatments is called sonophoresis or phonophoresis. When assessing the anatomy of the scalp we see the stratum corneum is the outermost layer of the epidermis, composed primarily of dead cells and lipids, which form the primary barrier between the body and the environment around us. The stratum corneum has a layered brick-like structure to it, which blocks the penetration of large molecules and moisture. The corneocytes are the cellular “bricks” that are fused together with lipids, creating the outermost barrier. TED hair restoration utilizes its ultrasonic hair growth sound waves at a very specific vibration or frequency to cause tiny, transient gaseous bubbles within the stratum corneum to rapidly expand and collapse, which then disorganizes the lipid bilayer and temporarily increases the permeability of the topical hair growth factor and peptide complex serum. This is the process of Alma TED hair restoration device or “TransEpidermal Delivery,” which creates a push-and-pull effect to deliver the growth factor and peptide serum complex for hair rejuvenation to reach the hair follicles located below the stratum corneum.\",\"nodeType\":\"text\"}],\"nodeType\":\"paragraph\"}],\"nodeType\":\"document\"}"
