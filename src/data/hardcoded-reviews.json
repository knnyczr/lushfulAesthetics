I started to become interested in injectables from seeing the ads on instagram. Based on the things I wanted to improve, Chris suggested that I do lip filler and cheek / jaw filler. Chris is an incredibly talented injector that takes the time to learn the patients unique anatomy to create a final product that has you looking like the very best version of yourself. Chris does a great job at explaining the process and making you feel comfortable throughout. I was so happy with my results, they were long-lasting and subtle. I definitely recommend Chris if you’re considering any injectable procedures."

More specifically, I am always welcomed to the office with not only a smile, but also bottled still or sparkling water.

Super knowledgeable about the muscles and anatomy of the face. He explained every step of the process and answered all of my questions. I received so many compliments about my face from my coworkers who had no idea that I get Botox. \n\n Hands down 5 Stars!!"

Steven the Practice Manager is always super helpful with scheduling. I recommend Chris to everyone because he really delivers great results everytime."

Really appreciated the awesome consultation because where I thought I needed work done was not the issue. Injector Chris told me I would see full results within 2 weeks, but I started seeing a major difference within 2 days! Great Customer Service and clean friendly environment. Highly recommended!"

From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with kindness and care, setting the tone for a truly exceptional service. \n\n What impressed me the most was how thoroughly Marco explained each step of the process, outlining the benefits and expected results of the facial. As someone with sensitive skin, I was grateful for the wealth of knowledge I gained about proper skincare and the reasons behind skin sensitivity and dryness. Marco's professionalism and expertise were evident throughout the entire session. \n\n The establishment itself was impeccably clean, creating a hygienic and inviting environment. The pleasant aroma that filled the space added to the overall sensory experience, I also appreciated the thoughtful touch of being able to choose my preferred music to accompany the treatment. \n\n The overall experience was nothing short of amazing. my face was left with a gorgeous, healthy glow, and I could feel the deep hydration within my skin. Marco truly went above and beyond to address my specific needs and concerns, ensuring that I left feeling satisfied and rejuvenated. \n\n I cannot recommend Lushful Esthetics and Marco highly enough. If you're looking for a professional, knowledgeable esthetician who provides exceptional care and delivers outstanding results, look no further. My experience was truly transformative, and I am grateful to Marco for his expertise and the incredible service I received."

    "text": "Some months ago, I began laser hair removal with a board-certified dermatologist who didn’t seem to practice aesthetic laser hair removal very frequently. The process was impossible—scheduling appointments took forever, and the lasering itself (with an Nd:YAG laser) was extremely slow going (appointments took ~1.5 hours). A friend recommended InjectorChris (Dr. Chris Bustamante), and I was immediately impressed by his rare combination of medical expertise and aesthetic treatment experience. (His prices are also not extortionate—another plus.) My appointments are now *so* easy to schedule, and they only take 15 to 20 min. from start to finish (vs. ~1.5 hours at the other place). InjectorChris has broad experience with different (darker) skin types, which made it possible for him to recommend the (faster-acting) Alexandrite laser over the (slower-acting but sometimes safer) Nd:YAG laser; I’m very glad he did, as this decision helped me to achieve faster, equally side effect-free results. I can’t say lasering is a walk in the park, but InjectorChris makes it bearable and *really* knows what he’s doing—I can’t recommend him more!"
